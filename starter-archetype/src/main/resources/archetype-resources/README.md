# Payara Starter Project

This is a sample application generated by the Payara Starter.

#[[##]]# Getting Started

#[[###]]# Prerequisites

- [Java SE ${javaVersion}+](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk${javaVersion})
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

#[[##]]# Running the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Make sure you have the appropriate Java version installed. We have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11, and Java SE 17.

3. Execute the following command:

```
#if (${platform} == 'server')
./mvn clean package cargo:run
#else
./mvn clean package payara-micro:start
#end
```

#if (${platform} == 'server')
4. Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}
#else
4. Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/
#end

#if (${docker} == 'true')
#[[##]]# Building a Docker Image
To build a Docker image for this application follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system.
Execute the following Maven command to build the Docker image:

```
mvn docker:build
```

This command will build a Docker image for your application.

Once the image is built, you can run a Docker container from the image using the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 ${artifactId}:${project.version}
```
Replace ${artifactId}:${project.version} with the actual image name and tag.

That's it! You have successfully built and run the application in a Docker container.
